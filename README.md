## How we analyze our picks: the core metrics behind our discovery of safe assets

### Daily Percent Change
Daily percentage change, the calculation of how much return a certain asset sees over the last trading day, is a building block for many more complex metrics, but is important in its own right. 

### Standard Deviation
The standard deviation of an equity is on way to measure how volitile that asset is. By tracking how often the equity exceeds its typical price bounds, you can tell whether or not that asset is likely to follow its current trend or see large fluctuations on any given day.

### Beta
For this tool, we will measure the beta against the S&P 500. An equities beta shows the volatility measured against the market as a whole. In this case a beta close to one is a stock that, on average, will see gains when the S&P 500 see's gains, and vice versa. 

### Sharpe Ratio
The sharpe ratio will determine the return of the investment versus the risk factor of the asset. The greater the value in the sharpes ratio the more attractive the risk adjusted return.

### Top 5 of the REIT stocks
In this section, the REIT stocks are compared to the S&P 500. With our smart filters, we have narrowed down the stocks for the day to 5 stocks. With these plots will help the investors to choose a potential stock. The percentage change is measured with the 5 best stocks, as well is with beta values and the top sharpes ratios are displayed.
