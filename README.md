## What you will find on TopTick
Our goal in creating this dashboard, is to demostrate the RIET stocks and compare it with the housing market. Also it can aid in the discovery of solid stocks that many investors may have not heard of. To fulfill this goal, no stock that appears here will have a market cap larger than $25 billion. Similarly, our focus is specifically on solid companies, therefore, no ETF's or trusts will be included.

Our daily top 5 buy's are stocks that meet all of our criteria for a good, investable asset.

Monte Carlo simulator. Based on our analysis of our top 5 buy's, our Monte Carlo simulation will give investors an even deeper look into the potential future earnings of a portfolio with our picks in them, weighted as you so choose.

## How we analyze our picks: the core metrics behind our discovery of safe assets

### Daily Percent Change
Daily percentage change, the calculation of how much return a certain asset sees over the last trading day, is a building block for many more complex metrics, but is important in its own right. 

### Standard Deviation
The standard deviation of an equity is on way to measure how volitile that asset is. By tracking how often the equity exceeds its typical price bounds, you can tell whether or not that asset is likely to follow its current trend or see large fluctuations on any given day.

### Beta
For this tool, we will measure the beta against the S&P 500. An equities beta shows the volatility measured against the market as a whole. In this case a beta close to one is a stock that, on average, will see gains when the S&P 500 see's gains, and vice versa.

### Sharpe Ratio
The sharpe ratio will determine the return of the investment versus the risk factor of the asset. The greater the value in the sharpes ratio the more attractive the risk adjusted return.
